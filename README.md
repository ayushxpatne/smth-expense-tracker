The application aims to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience to track their expenses efficiently on both Android and iOS devices. The primary goal is to offer a feature-rich, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform for individuals and businesses to manage their financial expenses effectively.

1. Budget Setting and Tracking: Users will be able  establish monthly budgets for various expense categories, and the app provides real-time updates and alerts when nearing or exceeding set limits.
2. Custom Categories: Currently, there are predefined categories from which users can choose from. I am aiming to add a Custom category feature in which users can add more categories which suits there needs.
3. Show respective month above the entries for entries on a particular month

### Known Issues:
1. No database / Data storage : As of now, the added expenses gets deleted once the app is closed. This is due to the lack of implementation of proper data storing method, such as creating a database. This project focused at getting familiar with Flutter Framework, hence this is not implemented yet.
